Proposal:
Weather and Energy Consumption: Explore how weather conditions influence energy consumption patterns. Analyze historical data to understand how factors like temperature, wind speed, and sunlight affect energy usage in different sectors such as residential, commercial, and industrial.
Research questions to answer:
1.) Average energy consumption based on weather conditions: cloudy, rainy, stormy, partially cloudy, windy, clear (edited) 
2.) Average temperature VS energy consumption in increments of 10 degrees, 100-90, 89-80,79-70 ect. 
3.) How does humidity affect energy usage? investigate the impact of humidity levels on energy consumption.
4.) how does precipitation affect energy consumption in incrementents of 1 inch of precipitation.
5.) revisit questions 1-4 while breaking down data further into residential, commercial, and industrial.
